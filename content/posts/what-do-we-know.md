When you set off on a new task or a new project it can be hard to decide if we should go with what we have always done, what we know now, or find a new way of doing things, what we we could be missing.

Fundamental to consulting is that you buy previous experience. Appeal to authority institutionalised. One might have done the wrong thing a 100 times, that does not make it right. One with a new, unproven idea, might be right and a lot more effective. The choice is ours.

Perhaps what we know is still valid. Perhaps itâ€™s out of date.

Where do we draw the line between researching new findings vs what we already know based on earlier findings or personal experience?

Does a man lost in the woods start walking or try to figure out how and where to walk?
