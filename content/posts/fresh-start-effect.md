Mondays, New Years, starting university. Sudden rush - enthusiasm.

Rainy Thursday in November after a few months - not so much.

Keeping momentum is hard. Reward progress. Visualize progress from past effort when starting a new month.

30/60 days feels better than seeing 0/30.

Fresh start can help but won't bring you to the finish line. Rather run 1 marathon than 26 small training sessions.
