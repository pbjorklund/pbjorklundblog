Consulting is strange. For every truthful response to a bid there will be multiple straight up lies or half truths.

“This will cost 10k$ and is not a problem. Here are 2 previous clients you can call to verify”

“This will cost at least 100k$ and is pretty difficult due to reasons 1 - 10. Here are 2 previous clients you can call to verify”

As a buyer, how am I supposed to know who to trust? How do I overcome my multiple biases?

As a seller - how can I compete while still holding my head high and winning business?

It’s hard being a buyer. And a seller. And a human in general.
