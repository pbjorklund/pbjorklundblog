Artificial intelligence or AI, as it is commonly known, is increasingly becoming a part of our everyday lives. 

You've probably heard about it in the news. 

But did you know that there's a specific type of AI that can help you boost your personal productivity? 

Enter generative AI.

## What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence that can create content similar to what a human would create. 

It's like having an assistant that can write emails, design graphics, and even compose music! 

The best part is - **you don't need any technical skills to use it.**

## Why Use Generative AI?

### Time-Saving

One of the biggest advantages of using generative AI is that it can save you a lot of time. 

Let's say you're working on a project and you need to create some graphics. 

Instead of spending hours trying to come up with something creative, you could just tell your generative AI tool what you're looking for and let it do the work for you!

### Increased Efficiency

Not only does generative AI save time, but it also increases efficiency by allowing us to focus on tasks that require our unique human skills - like strategic thinking or building relationships.

### Help in Creativity

Even if you're not particularly artistic or musically inclined, generative AI can help spark creativity by providing new ideas and inspiration.

## How to Use Generative AI?

Getting started with generative AI is easier than you might think!

### Step 1: Find the Right Tool 

There's an array of tools available online that are powered by this type of artificial intelligence. 

They range from writing assistants to graphic design tools and even music composition software.

### Step 2: Understand Your Needs 

Before choosing a tool, consider what tasks consume most of your time or where your productivity could use a boost.

### Step 3: Start Small 

You don't have to jump in head-first. 

Start with smaller tasks like drafting an email or creating a simple graphic then gradually increase complexity as you get more comfortable using these tools.
