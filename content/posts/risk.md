Its all about risk.

Surviving through employment / starting a successful business / building a career. I don't think most people think about their path in life as a selection of risk level.

Add to that the tolerance of risk. And timing.

A 20s something white guy with wealthy parents can take different risks than ... most people.

And who do we value? The risk takers, the billionaries, the moviestars. All very unlikely outcomes.

I love biographies and business books. But they are all describing statistical anomalies. And taking their path will most likely not net you the same result.
