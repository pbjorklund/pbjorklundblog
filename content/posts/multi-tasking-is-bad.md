Multitasking - a term often lauded as a beacon of productivity; a skill that separates the efficacious from the idle. 

Today it seems only natural to juggle multiple tasks at once. However, despite our admiration for this seemingly superhuman ability, recent scientific studies[^1][^2][^3] suggest that we may be overestimating our multitasking prowess.

## The Illusion of Multitasking

Conventionally, multitasking is perceived as simultaneously performing two or more tasks. However, it's more accurately described as **rapidly toggling our attention and focus between different tasks**. It appears that our brains lack the architecture to perform multiple complex tasks simultaneously.

That our brains lacks the architecture means that our brains are not designed to handle multiple tasks at the same time. 

This rapid task-switching comes with a cognitive cost known as "task switch costs" - negative effects such as slower pace and increased propensity for errors. For example, students who multitask in class tend to have lower GPAs[^4].

## Overconfidence in Multitasking: A Common Pitfall

Interestingly, research indicates that **we tend to inflate our perceived ability to multitask**. This inflated self-perception is intriguingly prevalent among frequent multitaskers who often lack the skills needed for effective multitasking.

Frequent multitaskers also exhibit higher impulsivity levels and are easily distracted. They seem to downplay possible risks associated with tackling multiple things at once and show lower levels of executive control.

## The Health Implications of Multitasking

Beyond productivity concerns, multitasking may also impact health negatively. It can reduce your ability to focus, increase feelings of stress and exacerbate impulsiveness Furthermore, decreased performance at work or school due to ineffective multitasking can lead to negative feelings and anxiety.

## So Why Do We Still Cling To Multitasking?

Despite these facts evidencing the inefficiencies of multitasking, why do we still hold on so dearly? Perhaps it's partly because society often praises the ability to juggle multiple tasks. Or maybe it's because sometimes the perception alone of being able to multitask boosts performance.

However, like an illusionist's trick - while it might seem magical on the surface - once you understand what's happening behind the scenes, you realize it’s just clever misdirection.
