Running a business and having 2 small kids with the world behaving the way it does brings stress. A lot of stress.

My life consists of bringing order to chaos. Creating repeatable, predictable and measurable results in a timely fashion.

When seeing the 52 week photo challenge it made me think about art and creativity.

The free exploration of ideas and feelings with no one true truth.

I want to see what this side of life has to offer.

That's the goal. I want to take photographs of things that make me feel. Anything.

Not sure what that means, but well see.
