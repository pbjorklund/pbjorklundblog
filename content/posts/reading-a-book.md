Notes as you are going to teach someone.

Annotating. Mark up books. Read like we are going to explain to a beginner. Flagging for future self. Active reading. Need correct headspace. 

Export and outline. Annotations will go somewhere. 
Write short summary. How would we teach section to someone? Beginner should be able to read outline and have good idea. 
Repeat for every section/chapter. 

Make lesson plan. We made many small ones. Now we create plan to teach whole book.

- [?] Why do I dislike repetition? Of thoughts? Saying things?

Active reflection. Using knowledge makes you retain it and really understöd it. Teaching is a good way to use it. 

- [k] Blogpost about note taking

Write letters to dead people. Then write their replies. Another way to use knowledge.
