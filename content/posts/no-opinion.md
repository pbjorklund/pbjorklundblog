Tonight I remind myself of Marcus Aurelius' words: _“You always own the option of having no opinion."_

Let’s dig a little in what I’m currently reflecting on.

##  Time Waste

Ever found yourself in a heated debate or discussion that ultimately led nowhere? Where the topic up for debate wasn’t even something truly important?

Time is precious; it's the one thing that we cannot get back.

Don’t waste it on unimportant things just to feed the ego.

## The Danger Of Uninformed Opinions

Another concern with constantly having an opinion is the risk associated with expressing views on topics you're not well-versed with when in a position of influence over others. 

There's a potential danger in this if others take your word as truth and act upon it.

By choosing to have no opinion on matters I'm not confident about, I am leaving the floor open for others to act. 

This honesty not only saves me from misguiding others but also opens avenues for me to learn from those who are better informed.

## Open-Mindedness

Perhaps one of the most significant benefits of a 'no-opinion' stance is the ability to listen more openly and attentively. 

When we jump into conversations with preconceived notions, there's a good chance we might miss out on new information or perspectives.

By withholding my immediate judgement or opinion, I allow myself to fully absorb what the other person has to say without any bias clouding my understanding. 

# In Conclusion

Adopting a 'no-opinion' stance doesn't mean becoming indifferent or apathetic; rather, it means choosing consciously where to invest your time and mental resources. 

It means being aware enough to admit when you don't know enough about something and being humble enough to listen before formulating any judgements.

As Marcus Aurelius suggested: _"These things are not asking to be judged by you. Leave them alone."_ 

So why not do just that and save ourselves some trouble, by leaving them alone? 

By doing so, we free up space for more constructive thoughts and actions - something which brings us closer each day towards leading a more fulfilling, and valuable, life.
