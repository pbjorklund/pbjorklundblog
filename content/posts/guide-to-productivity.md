So many self-help books. All promising to change your life. But let's face it, they are usually 300 pages of redundant information. That's why I present to you the most compact self-help guide ever.

## Think

First things first - **think things through**. Rushing into actions without any forethought is just a recipe for disaster. Give your brain some credit and use it!

## Break it down

Learn to **break large tasks down to small tasks**. Each small task in itself should create some value and together they should culminate into something larger than life.

## Prioritize

Once you've broken down the tasks, **ruthlessly prioritize** them. It's essential to know which battles to pick in order to win the war.

## One thing at a time

Let's move on - remember this mantra: “Stop starting - start finishing”. One task at a time keeps you moving towards your goals. 

## Plan

Eisenhower is famous for the quote: "Plans are worthless, but planning is everything.". One could also sum it up as "Planning is re-planning". 

Plan, but don't let the plan become your master. Adapt as needed.

## Have fun

Don’t forget to **have fun and set aside time for creativity and exploration**. All work and no play can make anyone go insane. Also it's my experience that new ideas originate in exploration and fun.

## Compare You vs You 

This one is vital - **don’t compare yourself with others** – compare you with YOU! Your real competition is your past self.

## Set, and change goals 

Getting somewhere requires knowing where that somewhere is. **Set long, medium and short term goals**, revisit them frequently and don't hesitate to change them if circumstances call for it.

## Communicate 

Remember – speaking isn't communicating unless what you've said has been understood rightly! So, **learn how to communicate clearly**.

## Do it 

The key here is simple – just start! Don’t let procrastination make a home in your routine. If you need an actionable tool then say to yourself, "I'm going to do this for 10 minutes. If I don't want to do it after that, I can stop". This saying took yours truly along some truly grueling accounting courses at university.

## Accept the constraints of reality 

Acceptance is key here– accept your reality. We all have only so many hours in a day – use them wisely! Reject hustle culture; don’t neglect other responsibilities while chasing dreams.

You are allowed to have friends, kids, a spouse and hobbies. Heart attacks, money and three divorces are actually not required to be classified as successful.

## Mind and body matter 

Eat well; do cardio; lift weights; meditate; do what your body needs.

## Consistency

Stop chasing the silver bullet – there ain't any shortcuts here folks! Good things take time and hard work over extended periods of time – if it was easy everyone else would be doing it already! Consistency is the key to success. 

## No excuses

Making excuses is just a way of avoiding responsibility for your actions. **Take responsibility and learn from your mistakes**. Excuses are the easy way out, but they don't change anything. Anyone who has ever accomplished anything has failed more times than not, it's ok.

## Control the controllables
Focus on what's in your control—actions, judgments & reactions—and accept uncontrollable situations.

## Summary
So there you have it. Lessons from a life, condensed into a single blog post. 

Apply these principles to your life and see the magic unfold on your deathbed. 

Remember - success isn't about the destination, it's about the journey and the person you become along the way. Keep evolving and don't forget to enjoy the ride!
