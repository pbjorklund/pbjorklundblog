A question that popped into my head today when reading some news about AI: 

> Why even write and create in the age of generative AI? 

If generative AI is, or becomes, greater than humans at producing any type of text (or any type of media) - then why create? Why invest time and effort into crafting words onto pages, taking that photo of a sunset or recording that video instead of generating it? Why go through the arduous process of learning to do anything creative? 

It's an interesting thought. Why create when the effort required to create is lowering day by day with advances in AI. And yes, the quality of the generated content is also improving rapidly.

There was an interesting [study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06798?utm_source=www.aiminds.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=why-lawyers-don-t-like-llms-bill-gates-foreshadows-medical-ai-and-ai-s-most-underrated-problem) that concluded that lawyers still prefer human written text to AI created text, so far so good. But what I think was interesting was that the participants in general seems to anticipate this to change in the future and are looking forward to it.

One thing that I know for the moment thouhg. Machines can't experience things. At least not in a way I care about. I don't want to read an AI generated memoir, but I would read AI generated fiction if it was good enough.

The second thing I know is that creating for purely selfish reasons is still a valid reason. It's ok to do something because it brings you joy. The world didn't stop playing chess when deep blue won.
