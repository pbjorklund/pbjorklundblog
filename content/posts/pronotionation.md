Fiddling around with a organizational system for notes can be soothing, and potentially a huge waste of time, but more than anything it’s an excellent way to procrastinate.

It did however allow me to setup a Kanban based workflow where I can view all areas together or separately. If I want to see a total image of everything I have to do, am doing, is blocked and have done I can now do it. That’s something.
