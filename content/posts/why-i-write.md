The reason for writing these posts is to have a place where I can go and look up my current understanding of a small subset of my notes. A subset of things I found interesting enough to share. Often time based on discussions I’ve had with people a few times.
# It lets me go back

It’s a place to go and see what I currently believe to be true and worth knowing and sharing about any topic. I can then reference this whenever discussing or writing anything, it’s easier to send a link than write the same message over and over.
# It makes it easier to reflect

I believe that knowledge is something fluid. It isn't a fixed entity, but something that grows, evolves, and changes over time. 

We gain new insights, learn new things, and adapt our beliefs according to new experiences and information.

Therefore, my writing habit serves as a journal of my journey through knowledge. 

It helps me track progress over time, reflect on past thoughts and ideas, and compare them with my current understanding.
# It helps me to stay organized

The more I learn about various topics, the harder it becomes to remember everything. Therefore, having this place helps me keep everything in order.
# It makes it more sticky

Furthermore, writing improves comprehension and retention of information. When I write down what I have learned or understood about a particular topic or concept, it reinforces that information in my mind and makes it easier for me to recall later.

# Other writing

This blog consists of a very small portion of what I write. 

I also keep/hoard notes on hundreds of subjects, ideas, thoughts and more. 

Maybe I’ll write a post about personal knowledge management, commonplace books, Zettelkasten, Obsidian/Notion, meeting minutes, writing as productive procrastination/just fun, ai writing etc in the future. Who knows?
