I wanted to listen to more music in 2025. So obviously I created a kanban board with 1 card per music genre from [Rate Your Musics list of Genres](https://rateyourmusic.com/genres/) and figured I can listen to the nr 1 rated album in each category. Then I should be able to say I gave most types of music a fair chance while figuring out what I like and don't like.

So the first thing I noticed is that there were a few more genres than I initially thought. A lot more. And I didn't even go deeper than 2 sub-levels of genras.

534 genres. As a friend said "So if you do 3 a day, it’ll only take you 2/3 of a year".

Seems resonable. And if I don't do it, take a break or take longer - who cares. This is ment to help me along one of my 2025 themes, "experience more art and culture" which has been really underprioritized in my life up until this point.

## The rating system
Adopted from Pitchforks old rating system (found in sidebar on [this archived site](https://web.archive.org/web/20011223071609/http://pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/k/kinks/preservation-act-1.shtml)) to work with RYMs 5 star with half star system.

## Genres listened to
Alright, here we go. The first batch of genres I listened to.
### Ambient Americana

> Made using traditional [Americana](https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/americana/) and [Country](https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/country/) instrumentation, typically to evoke a pastoral atmosphere.

[RYM Link](https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/ambient-americana)

Nr1 album Wichita Lineman / Guinnevere Dick Slessig was not on tidal. Jumped to nr 2.
#### [Old Saw - Country Tropics](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/old-saw/country-tropics/)

Ambient Americana, sounds exactly like I would have suspected I guess. 

Weeds tumbling across the desert as we drive along some Arizona highway. Not my cup of tea but interesting . 
#### Rating
Solid two stars ★★ 

### Ambient

> Combines the theory and atmosphere of Ambient with traditional instruments and sounds from around the globe.

[RYM Link](https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/ambient)

#### [Eno - Another green world](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/eno/another-green-world/)
Strange, but not to strange. Expected more strange. 
”Bit”ish somehow. Not to memorable. 
Don’t know what makes this a masterpiece. 
#### Rating
★★½  stars. 
 
### Blues

> Originated toward the end of the 19th century in African American communities in the United States, particularly the Deep South; drew on traditional [Spirituals](https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/spirituals/) and [Work Song](https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/work-song/); highly influential to the whole of Western popular music.

[RYM Link](https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/blues/)

#### [Nina Simone - Nina Simone Sings the Blues (1966)](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/nina-simone/nina-simone-sings-the-blues/) 
Well. It was bluesy alright. 
Not really captivating me. Sensuality and strife. Probably made more sense in the 60s. Good time to reflect on that the world is actually better in a lot of ways than it was before, not everything is going the wrong way. Thanks Nina.
#### Rating
★★★ stars

### Classical Music

> Virtuoso piece, usually for solo keyboard or plucked string instrument, characterized by its free rhythm, rapid fingerwork, and contrasting sectional writing.

[RYM Link](https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/toccata/)

[Steve Reich and Musicians - Music for 18 Musicians (1978)](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/steve-reich-and-musicians/music-for-18-musicians-2/) - was ok as background music. Didn't really say anything to me.
#### Rating
★★★ stars

### Drift Phonk

> Busy, noisy production inspired by lo-fi Memphis Rap; frequently features 808 cowbell melodies and chopped, compressed samples.

[RYM Link](https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/drift-phonk/)

#### [Kordhell & Scarlxrd - Psychx](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/kordhell-scarlxrd/psychx/)

Reminds me of [ICP](https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/insane-clown-posse). Don’t know why I liked it but I do. A mix of metal growling and rap.
#### Rating
★★★½ stars
### Funkot

> Fast-paced Indonesian form of Electronic Dance Music that combines Eurodance and Trance synths with the syncopated rhythm from Dangdut koplo.

[RYM Link](https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/funkot/)

#### [Bandung bergoyang - Barakatak](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/barakatak/bandung-bergoyang/)

First impression: "Wow. This sucks".

Listening to this album makes me feel a bit racist and dismissive of Indonesian culture. Lots of high pitched singing, small ”tube trums” etc. Not my cup of tea.
#### Rating
★ star

### Europop

> Emerged throughout mainland Europe in the early 1970s, referring to slick, highly commercial Pop songs that emphasize sugary melodies and light, bouncy instrumentation.

[RYM Link](https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/europop/)
#### [Sandra - Into a Secret Land](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/sandra/into-a-secret-land/) 
Yeah this should have stayed in the 80s. American Pshycho vibes for sure. Old ABBA era dance music - but worse.
#### Rating
★★ stars
### Emo

> Focuses on emotional lyrics, expressive vocals, melodic songwriting, and dynamic song structures.

[RYM Link](https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/emo/)

#### [My Chemical Romance](https://rateyourmusic.com/artist/my-chemical-romance "[Artist8034]") - Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge 

I just had to go with MCR even though it was nr 5 on the list of most highly rated Emo albums. When I think of Emo I think of MCR.

And no, no it's not for me. Vocals doesn't sound great, music sounds "sloppy" somehow. I guess never having been into it when young also helps kill some of the "glow" that can exist around music.
#### Rating
★½ stars

### Mathcore

> Rhythmically complex, features unconventional time signatures, syncopated and dissonant riffs and erratic metric shifts.

[RYM Link](https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/mathcore/)
#### [Converge - Jane Doe](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/converge/jane-doe/)

What a f-n ride. Anger. Dissonance. Totally incomprehensible vocals even when reading the lyrics. Almost turned it off after 5 seconds. But … it grew on me. At the end I was kinda sad to see it go. 

Perhaps need to listen to it just once more…

★★★★ stars
