I wanted to listen to more music in 2025. So obviously I created a kanban board with 1 card per music genre from [Rate Your Musics list of Genres](https://rateyourmusic.com/genres/) and figured I can listen to the nr 1 rated album in each category. Then I should be able to say I gave most types of music a fair chance while figuring out what I like and don't like.
## The rating system
This is the rating system I use when evaluating albums.

| Star Rating | Description                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ★★★★★       | Essential, Spectacular                                                                                             |
| ★★★★½       | Amazing, maybe a few very tiny flaws. Exceptional; will likely rank among my top ten albums of the year, Very good |
| ★★★★        | Very good                                                                                                          |
| ★★★½        | Above average; enjoyable                                                                                           |
| ★★★         | Not brilliant, but nice enough                                                                                     |
| ★★½         | Has its moments, but isn't strong                                                                                  |
| ★★          | Mediocre; not good, but not awful, Just below average; bad outweighs good by just a little bit                     |
| ★½          | Definitely below average, but a few redeeming qualities                                                            |
| ★           | Heard worse, but still pretty bad; Awful; not a single pleasant track                                              |
| ½           | Breaks new ground for terrible                                                                                     |

## Genres listened to
The second batch of genres I listened to. See first batch [here](music-genre-deep-dive), second here [music-genre-deep-dive-update-1](music-genre-deep-dive-update-1.md).

### Death Metal

> Heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, palm-muted, tremolo-picked riffs, double-kick and blast beat percussion, chromatic chord progressions, minor keys, abrupt changes in tempo, and guttural vocals.

[RYM Link](https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/death-metal/)

[Autopsy - Mental Funeral](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/autopsy/mental-funeral/)

Really catchy. Can you say that about death metal? Nice mix of heavier slower guitar and the more lighter metal with accompanying speed in general on tracks like Slaughterday. Like it how it's not just and endless "drone of darkness" and that they actually throw in some interesting guitar and other arrangements.

> "When I enjoy myself with a corpse, it's a high beyond any I've ever had". 
 
Well, that's a great illustration of the death part of death metal I think.

Reminds me of this reddit thread "[What’s the most inappropriate thing to say at a funeral?](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/gf7vdg/whats_the_most_inappropriate_thing_to_say_at_a/)".

★★★ stars.

### Jazz Fusion

> Near-universal usage of electric guitars and keyboards coupled with influences from genres such as Rock, Rhythm & Blues, Funk, and Traditional Folk Music, and a relative degree of harmonic simplicity.

[RYM Link](https://rateyourmusic.com/genre/jazz-fusion/)

[Hiromi - Alive](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/the-trio-project/alive/) 

 <img src="http://e.snmc.io/i/300/w/fd6faa2d9399589f977f347dedf3f7af/5244930" alt="The Trio Project - Alive">

Really liked this. The piano is front and center as it should be for this artist but the rest is also really enjoyable. Fusion is great.

★★★★ stars

### Death Doom

> Fuses down-tuned guitars, growled vocals, and aggressive, often double-kick drumming with a mournful, somber atmosphere and plodding tempos.

Oh man, my new favourite genre. Made me go and buy [The Tritonus Bell - Hooded Menace](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/hooded-menace/the-tritonus-bell/) on Bandcamp as well as [Never Cross The Dead](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/hooded-menace/never-cross-the-dead/). Both really stellar albums. Totally making me question the whole "buy physical media" kick I'm on. Still, I want it on Vinyl - but without paying as much in shipping as I do for the actual record.

Turns out I enjoy the slow, heavy guitars and drums, deep growling.

Lead into listening to Autopsy and their album [Mental Funeral](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/autopsy/mental-funeral/)which RYM classifies as both Death Doom and [Death Metal](Death%20Metal.md).

Anyways.

[The Tritonus Bell - Hooded Menace](https://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/hooded-menace/the-tritonus-bell/)

Great low growling, heavy guitar riffs. Slow, dark, wonderful.

★★★★ stars
## Other listening and related things

I have begun converting all my Tidal favorites to CDs or digital downloads. This will take a while (years) since I'm not made of money and will only be "converting" things that are worth keeping. Curation!

Went and picked up 

Things that are really special I will try to get on Vinyl.

Speaking of that I have a whole stack of thrift store vinyl to clean up and play through. Jazz from like 1938 to latest 1950 perhaps? Glenn Miller, Bill Acker, Count Basie, Armstrong etc etc. Picking up everything that sounds remotely interesting and where price is like 1$ or under.

### Current HiFi setup
Made some (what I think at least) good second hand finds recently which made me end up with a bunch of different audio setups.

Used to have a pair of Edifier active bookshelf speakers and a cheap Lenco L-85 - so upgrades have been made.

When I settle down on how I want things set up I'll do the cable management again.

#### Setup 1 - Vinyl, CD & Roon for active listening
- **Turntable:** Rega Planar 2 with standard Carbon cartridge - RCA to RIAA (6500 SEK from Akkelis Audio)

#### Setup 2 - Computer for work
Previously, the computer only used the monitor's built-in speakers, so this was an upgrade.

- **Amplifier:** Technics SA-160 from around 1988 (500 SEK on Blocket)
- **Speakers:** Jamo E800 on stands - Kjell.com Luxorparts Speaker Cable 2.5 mm² White (500 SEK including stands and cables on Blocket)

#### Setup 3 - Mobile
- **Mobile phone:** iPhone 14 Pro (idk, to many SEK when new in 2023)
- **DAC:** Apple Thunderbolt to 3.5mm headphone dongle (about 100 SEK I think new, got it for free before when Apple transitioned)

Let's not get into the discussion of audiophilia and subjectivism vs objectivism today. That whole world is all kinds of ... confusing and hard to really grasp where the draw the line. Is HiFi considered ... art?

## Thats all folks

Alright, there we have it. I'll try to post a roundup like this from time to time for record keeping. To see more what I listen to check out my [profile on RYM](https://rateyourmusic.com/~pbjorklund).
