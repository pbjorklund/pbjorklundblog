Frying pancakes could work well in Sweden as a metaphor for agility.

"More butter in the next one!"

"Not so thick.."

â€œOh, coconut and peanut butter were great. Try it now"

"No thank you now I am full, you take the next one."

"Everyone satisfied? Great, I'll put the rest of the mix in the fridge for lunch tomorrow".

Because who in their right mind makes a complete batch and before sitting down to eat?
