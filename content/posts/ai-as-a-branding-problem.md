Let's take a moment to ponder on the curious case of Coca Cola and Pepsi. Despite blind taste tests often favoring Pepsi, Coca Cola continues to reign supreme in the market. The difference lies not in the taste, but in the branding. Coca Cola's strong brand identity has led many to prefer it over its rival. Now, let's apply this lens to another domain — artificial intelligence (AI). As technological advancements push AI towards generating content that rivals human creativity, one can't help but wonder: will people still value slightly inferior human creations over superior AI-generated ones, simply because of the 'brand' associated with human creativity?

## The Branding Magic: Human vs AI Creations
Branding is a powerful tool. It can alter perceptions and create biases that often defy logic. Just as the ubiquitous red can and classic logo of Coca Cola overshadow Pepsi’s taste advantage, could the 'brand' associated with human creativity eclipse the technical superiority of AI?

As humans, we have a bias towards fellow humans — their thoughts, emotions, and experiences that shape their creative output. We value art because we value its creators; we appreciate their vulnerability in baring their souls through their work. Even if an AI could emulate this process perfectly, would we value it in quite the same way? Or would our inherent bias towards our species — our own 'brand', so to speak — lead us to dismiss AI creations as mere imitations?

## The Rise of Generative AI
This isn't just a philosophical debate; we're already seeing this play out in real-time with generative AIs such as OpenAI's GPT-4 or DALL-E. These systems can generate text and images that are virtually indistinguishable from those created by humans.

Take Midjourney for instance; it uses cutting-edge technology to create designs that can rival those of professional graphic designers. Yet, despite the quality of its output, it's still viewed primarily as a tool, not a creator. Does this reflect our inability to see AI as more than just machines? Or is it a manifestation of our inherent bias towards human creativity?

## Watermarking AI: A New Debate
The growing influence of AI in creative fields has led to calls for watermarking AI-generated content. This stems from a desire for transparency, but also raises new questions. If we start watermarking AI content, would it further widen the gap between human and AI creations? If this is the aim: would it actually impact our biases and perception?

Further the challenge lies not just in implementing such a system, but ensuring compliance across all levels, including governments and private “traditional” corporations. It's one thing to propose watermarking; it's another entirely to enforce it.

## Counterarguments & Rebuttals
Some might argue that the inherent biases in artificial intelligence could be influencing our preference for human-made creations. However, if we strip away these biases — if an AI-created poem or painting was indistinguishable from a human-created one — would we value them equally? Or would our knowledge of their origins still lead us to favor the 'real' over the 'simulated'?

## Conclusion
Branding isn't just about logos and taglines; it's about perception and bias. Just as Coca Cola's brand identity has influenced consumer preference despite Pepsi’s taste advantage, so too does the 'brand' associated with human creativity affect our perception of AI-generated content.

As technology continues to blur the line between human and machine creativity, we must engage with these difficult questions. How much does knowing who or what created something impact its perceived value? Are we prepared to let go of our biases and appreciate art for what it is, irrespective of its origins?

In conclusion, while generative AIs continue to evolve at an unprecedented pace, our perception of their creations will be continually shaped by our biases. Until we can separate the art from the artist — or in this case, the AI — branding will continue to play a defining role in how we value creativity.
