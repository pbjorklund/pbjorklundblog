And the Lord of Code spake unto the developers, saying:

I. Thou shalt have no other best practices before me. Worship the principles of clean code and maintainability, for they shall guide thee in thy darkest hours of debugging.

II. Thou shalt not create graven images of code, nor shall thou copy-paste from the unholy realm of Stack Overflow without understanding. For the Lord of Code doth know the heart of thine functions, and He shall judge them accordingly.

III. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord of Code in vain. Speaketh not blasphemies against the languages and frameworks thou hast chosen, for their creators have labored tirelessly to provide thee with tools for thy labor.

IV. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. For six days shalt thou labor and do all thy work; but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord of Code. In it, thou shalt not do any work, neither thou, nor thy code reviewer, nor thy manager.

V. Honor thy project manager and thy product owner, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord of Code giveth thee. For they bring forth the requirements and ensure thy work is aligned with the will of the users.

VI. Thou shalt not kill the performance of thy software, nor shall thou allow memory leaks and unoptimized algorithms to fester within thy code. For these shall surely cause thy software to be cast into the pit of obsolescence.

VII. Thou shalt not commit adultery against thy coding standards. Be consistent in thine indentation and syntax, and resist the temptations of inconsistency. For a unified codebase is pleasing unto the Lord of Code.

VIII. Thou shalt not steal the work of others without proper attribution. Honor the licenses of open-source software, and do not take credit for the labor of thy brethren, lest thy reputation be tarnished among the community.

IX. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor's code. Give credit where it is due, and do not sully the reputation of thy peers with baseless accusations. For thou shalt surely be judged by thine own actions.

X. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's tools, frameworks, or libraries. Seek not to replicate the success of others through envy, but rather strive to improve thine own craft through diligence, humility, and continued learning. For the Lord of Code shall reward the faithful and the diligent.
