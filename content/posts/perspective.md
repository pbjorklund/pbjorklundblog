“From a management perspective, having everything reduced to a process and method is the ideal world, as no true knowledge about the actual work is needed. The weaker then understanding of the work, the stronger the desire to replace uncertainty with process”

Important to not forget about this perspective when spending all day in the “management system” and “productivity” space.
