There's this expectation for politicians and any person in a position of authority (or dare we say “influence”) to guide the general public through complex issues. 

But here's the thing - most of us don't have the bandwidth to really get into the nitty-gritty of every topic. So, we lean on these conduits for clarity. However, this reliance has a downside: it's a small step from being guided to being manipulated. 

It's like, at what point do we stop making our own choices and start following a script laid out for us?

So, how should I navigate this maze without losing my agency? It's not about doubting everything but rather about engaging with information in a more thoughtful way. 

Perhaps this checklist would help.

1. Accept that simple answers might not always cut it. It's about embracing the complexity rather than shying away from it.
   
2. Dig a bit deeper into issues. It's not about becoming an expert overnight but about trying to see beyond the surface.
   
3. Consider who's talking and their possible motivations. This context can help differentiate genuine guidance from hidden manipulation.
   
4. Looking at different sources can help paint a fuller picture.
   
5. Think about the intended effect of the statements on public opinion or policy. Who stands to gain, and what's their endgame?

7. Think again and accept that truly thinking takes time and effort.

This is really about taking charge of how to engage with information in general. It's about not being just a passive receiver but an active, informed member of the conversation.

So, the takeaway from today's reflection: stay informed, stay critical, and always keep questioning. And since it takes effort - be selective on what deserves attention.
