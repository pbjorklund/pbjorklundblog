                        <p>&ldquo;Consistency is key.&rdquo; This mantra has been drilled into our heads, especially in the era of social media influencers and YouTubers. But what if our relentless pursuit of consistency is costing us something far more valuable: quality?</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve become obsessed with regularity, with churning out content like clockwork, fearing that any deviation from our rigid schedules will send followers fleeing. However, in our fixation on consistency, we risk diluting the quality of our work.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a step back and remember why we started creating in the first place: to offer something unique, to touch people with our insights or stories. Isn&rsquo;t it better to give audiences a well-crafted novel that took years to perfect than a hastily written monthly release?</p>
<p>The drive for consistency has become synonymous with hustle culture â€” always be producing, always be working. But at what cost? The constant grind can lead to burnout, and that guarantees 0 consistency.</p>
<p>The solution lies in finding the middle ground. A sustainable schedule that values both quality and consistency is key. Leveraging AI where beneficial can lighten the load but should not replace human creativity.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s reconsider the mantra: Consistency is important, yes. But not when it compromises quality or wellbeing. Let&rsquo;s aim for consistent quality instead of consistently mediocre output â€” now that&rsquo;s a motto worth living by!</p>

                        <p>Multitasking - a term often lauded as a beacon of productivity; a skill that separates the efficacious from the idle.</p>
<p>Today it seems only natural to juggle multiple tasks at once. However, despite our admiration for this seemingly superhuman ability, recent scientific studies[^1][^2][^3] suggest that we may be overestimating our multitasking prowess.</p>
<h2 id="the-illusion-of-multitasking">
  The Illusion of Multitasking

</h2>
<p>Conventionally, multitasking is perceived as simultaneously performing two or more tasks. However, it&rsquo;s more accurately described as <strong>rapidly toggling our attention and focus between different tasks</strong>. It appears that our brains lack the architecture to perform multiple complex tasks simultaneously.</p>
<p>That our brains lacks the architecture means that our brains are not designed to handle multiple tasks at the same time.</p>
<p>This rapid task-switching comes with a cognitive cost known as &ldquo;task switch costs&rdquo; - negative effects such as slower pace and increased propensity for errors. For example, students who multitask in class tend to have lower GPAs[^4].</p>
<h2 id="overconfidence-in-multitasking-a-common-pitfall">
  Overconfidence in Multitasking: A Common Pitfall

    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>Interestingly, research indicates that <strong>we tend to inflate our perceived ability to multitask</strong>. This inflated self-perception is intriguingly prevalent among frequent multitaskers who often lack the skills needed for effective multitasking.</p>
<p>Frequent multitaskers also exhibit higher impulsivity levels and are easily distracted. They seem to downplay possible risks associated with tackling multiple things at once and show lower levels of executive control.</p>

    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>Beyond productivity concerns, multitasking may also impact health negatively. It can reduce your ability to focus, increase feelings of stress and exacerbate impulsiveness Furthermore, decreased performance at work or school due to ineffective multitasking can lead to negative feelings and anxiety.</p>
<h2 id="so-why-do-we-still-cling-to-multitasking">
  So Why Do We Still Cling To Multitasking?

  </a>
</h2>
<p>Despite these facts evidencing the inefficiencies of multitasking, why do we still hold on so dearly? Perhaps it&rsquo;s partly because society often praises the ability to juggle multiple tasks. Or maybe it&rsquo;s because sometimes the perception alone of being able to multitask boosts performance.</p>
<p>However, like an illusionist&rsquo;s trick - while it might seem magical on the surface - once you understand what&rsquo;s happening behind the scenes, you realize itâ€™s just clever misdirection.</p>

                        <p>The societal pressure to be productive is at an all-time high. Hustle culture, &ldquo;just get sh*t done&rdquo;, &ldquo;No-one succeeded by working 40 hour weeks&rdquo; is a constant reminder in our social feeds. Self-help books, motivational speakers, and social media influencers who promote extreme productivity with posts like &ldquo;How I study for 18 hours without getting tired&rdquo; seems to be everywhere. And this is what is starting to be referred to more and more as &ldquo;Toxic Productivity&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Toxic productivity is the state of pushing oneself to be productive at any cost, ignoring other facets of your life. It may seem beneficial in the short term as it often leads to increased performance due to that inital adrenaline rush or that feeling of truly being on the right path for once. However, this relentless pursuit of efficiency is not sustainable and often results in burnout, stress, mental health issues like anxiety or depression, and even physical ailments such as heart disease.</p>
<p>Ironically, toxic productivity often also leads to even more procrastination - we procrastinate by trying to figure out how to not procrastinate.</p>
<p>Although these productivity gurus may seem appealing due to their success stories, these portrayals often gloss over the risk of burnout and mental health struggles associated with such behaviour. Also interesting to see how some of the more succesful influencers that started with the clickbait titles and built up a huge following now comes out with things like &ldquo;Stress free productivity&rdquo; or &ldquo;I burnt out. Here is what I changed&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Instead of striving for non-stop productivity, it&rsquo;s healthier and more sustainable to set realistic goals that align with your personal capabilities and lifestyle. This can prevent feelings of failure when unrealistic expectations arenâ€™t met â€“ thereby counteracting toxic productivity.</p>
<p>Moreover, incorporating self-care activities into your routine is not a waste of time but a critical part of maintaining overall health and wellbeing â€“ thereby enhancing true productivity in the long run.</p>
<p>Workplaces also play a crucial role in either promoting or counteracting toxic productivity. Organizations should strive for cultures that value balance and wellbeing alongside productivity. Implementing policies such as flexible working hours or providing mental health support can help prevent toxic work environments.</p>
<p>To combat toxic productivity, consider techniques such as <em>simple</em> time management strategies instead of convoluted ones, mindfulness practices or simply turning off email and notifications for an hour per day. If feelings of burnout persist despite these measures, seeking professional help like therapy or coaching could be beneficial.</p>
<p>At its core, true productivity isnâ€™t about working harder but about working <em>smarter</em> and <em>sustainably</em> â€“ prioritizing tasks effectively is one thing, getting them done is another. But we should remember that taking breaks are not hindrances but fundamental components for producing quality work. Ever banged your head against the keyboard for hours without making progress on something truly difficulty and then going to the bathroom only to instantly come up with the solution? Yeah, breaks are the true productivity super power.</p>
<p>Rest must not be seen as an adversary but an essential partner in our quest for genuine productivity. By maintaining a healthy balance between work and restâ€”and being mindful not to fall into the trap of toxic productivityâ€”we can perform at our best while safeguarding our wellbeing.</p>

                        <p>Being sure is a captivating cognitive concept. It&rsquo;s not fixed, but fluid, as our beliefs continually face challenges from new information and perspectives.</p>
<p>This requires a balance between skepticism and acceptance. We must be willing to change our minds when presented with compelling evidence but resist changing beliefs hastily without critical analysis.</p>
<p>At the same time we must balance this to avoid excessive skepticism leading to decision paralysis or severe anxiety. Analysis paralysis.</p>
<p>While some uncertainty promotes intellectual growth and open-mindedness, too much can be crippling.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s not about knowing everything; it&rsquo;s having confidence in your current knowledge while staying open to, and actively seeking, learning.</p>
<p>Leaders of all types must frequently make decisions that will impact an entire organizations (or at least a group of people). Often with incomplete or uncertain information.</p>
<p>But a leader who is unwaveringly certain all the time can come across as arrogant, inflexible, and unwilling to listen to others&rsquo; perspectives. On the other hand, a leader who is plagued by doubt and haphazardly changes its mind can seem indecisive and insecure.</p>
<p>The best leaders strike a balance. They are confident enough to make tough decisions and take responsibility for them, but humble enough to admit when they are wrong or don&rsquo;t have all the answers. They foster an environment where ideas can be challenged and different perspectives are valued. And they know when itâ€™s time to stop the debate and move to action.</p>
<p>Being sure doesn&rsquo;t mean having all the answers. It&rsquo;s about knowing what you know and what you don&rsquo;t know, being open to new information and perspectives while maintaining your core beliefs until evidence compels you otherwise.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where real certainty lies - not in blind belief or crippling doubt but in thoughtful consideration, open-mindedness, resilience in face of uncertainty, and above all else - adaptability. This is the art of being sure.</p>
