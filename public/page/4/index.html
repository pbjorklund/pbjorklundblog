                        <p>Tonight I remind myself of Marcus Aurelius&rsquo; words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>â€œYou always own the option of having no opinion.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Letâ€™s dig a little in what Iâ€™m currently reflecting on.</p>
<h2 id="time-waste">
  Time waste
  <a class="heading-link" href="#time-waste">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>Ever found yourself in a heated debate or discussion that ultimately led nowhere? Where the topic up for debate wasnâ€™t even something truly important?</p>
<p>Time is precious; it&rsquo;s the one thing that we cannot get back.</p>
<p>Donâ€™t waste it on unimportant things just to feed the ego.</p>
<h2 id="the-danger-of-uninformed-opinions">
  The danger of uninformed opinions
  <a class="heading-link" href="#the-danger-of-uninformed-opinions">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>Another concern with constantly having an opinion is the risk associated with expressing views on topics you&rsquo;re not well-versed with when in a position of influence over others.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a potential danger in this if others take your word as truth and act upon it.</p>
<p>By choosing to have no opinion on matters I&rsquo;m not confident about, I am leaving the floor open for others to act.</p>
<p>This honesty not only saves me from misguiding others but also opens avenues for me to learn from those who are better informed.</p>
<h2 id="open-mindedness">
  Open-mindedness
  <a class="heading-link" href="#open-mindedness">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>Perhaps one of the most significant benefits of a &rsquo;no-opinion&rsquo; stance is the ability to listen more openly and attentively.</p>
<p>When we jump into conversations with preconceived notions, there&rsquo;s a good chance we might miss out on new information or perspectives.</p>
<p>By withholding my immediate judgement or opinion, I allow myself to fully absorb what the other person has to say without any bias clouding my understanding.</p>
<h2 id="closing-thoughts">
  Closing thoughts
  <a class="heading-link" href="#closing-thoughts">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>Adopting a &rsquo;no-opinion&rsquo; stance doesn&rsquo;t mean becoming indifferent or apathetic; rather, it means choosing consciously where to invest your time and mental resources.</p>
<p>It means being aware enough to admit when you don&rsquo;t know enough about something and being humble enough to listen before formulating any judgements.</p>
<p>As Marcus Aurelius suggested:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;These things are not asking to be judged by you. Leave them alone.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So why not do just that and save ourselves some trouble, by leaving them alone?</p>
<p>By doing so, we free up space for more constructive thoughts and actions - something which brings us closer each day towards leading a more fulfilling, and valuable, life.</p>

                        <p>The reason for writing these posts is to have a place where I can go and look up my current understanding of a small subset of my notes. A subset of things I found interesting enough to share. Often time based on discussions Iâ€™ve had with people a few times.</p>
<h1 id="it-lets-me-go-back">
  It lets me go back

    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h1>
<p>Itâ€™s a place to go and see what I currently believe to be true and worth knowing and sharing about any topic. I can then reference this whenever discussing or writing anything, itâ€™s easier to send a link than write the same message over and over.</p>
<h1 id="it-makes-it-easier-to-reflect">

</h1>
<p>I believe that knowledge is something fluid. It isn&rsquo;t a fixed entity, but something that grows, evolves, and changes over time.</p>
<p>We gain new insights, learn new things, and adapt our beliefs according to new experiences and information.</p>
<p>Therefore, my writing habit serves as a journal of my journey through knowledge.</p>
<p>It helps me track progress over time, reflect on past thoughts and ideas, and compare them with my current understanding.</p>
<h1 id="it-helps-me-to-stay-organized">
  It helps me to stay organized
  <a class="heading-link" href="#it-helps-me-to-stay-organized">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h1>
<p>The more I learn about various topics, the harder it becomes to remember everything. Therefore, having this place helps me keep everything in order.</p>
<h1 id="it-makes-it-more-sticky">
  It makes it more sticky
  <a class="heading-link" href="#it-makes-it-more-sticky">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h1>
<p>Furthermore, writing improves comprehension and retention of information. When I write down what I have learned or understood about a particular topic or concept, it reinforces that information in my mind and makes it easier for me to recall later.</p>

  Other writing

  </a>
</h1>
<p>This blog consists of a very small portion of what I write.</p>
<p>I also keep/hoard notes on hundreds of subjects, ideas, thoughts and more.</p>
<p>Maybe Iâ€™ll write a post about personal knowledge management, commonplace books, Zettelkasten, Obsidian/Notion, meeting minutes, writing as productive procrastination/just fun, ai writing etc in the future. Who knows?</p>

                        <p>Imagine this scenario:</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re at work, just finished a report heavily created by generative AI like ChatGPT, but there&rsquo;s a glaring error pointed out by your supervisor.</p>
<p>Instead of accepting responsibility, your instant reaction is to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that? That must&rsquo;ve been the AI! It&rsquo;s always messing things up.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As humorous as it may sound, with generative AI becoming more integrated into our daily lives through tools such as ChatGPT and Office 365 Copilot I believe we might start hearing excuses like these more frequently.
But here&rsquo;s the crux of the matter:</p>
<p>With AI becoming more incorporated in our lives and even handling some/most of our professional responsibilities, how do we ensure personal accountability remains intact?</p>
<p>We must remember these tools are not infallible. Just like us humans (shocker alert!), they can make mistakes too.</p>
<p>The AI tools operate as advanced statisticians writing text purely from what makes statistical sense, not what makes human sense, and generate content based on inputs provided by us.</p>
<p>Therefore we can never fully trust the output to be factually correct, no matter how good it sounds.</p>
<p>The human is still accountable for the correctness of the output - not the AI.</p>
<p>If not, what do we even need the human in the loop for?</p>

    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve made an error or overlooked something the AI tool generated mistakenly - admit it!</p>
<p>Not only will it make you a better human, it will teach others to avoid the same overreliance on tools.</p>
<p>Remember that making mistakes is part of being human; itâ€™s how we learn and grow.</p>
<p>So instead of blaming our silicon counterparts when things go awry - let&rsquo;s take responsibility!</p>

    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>

</h2>
<p>In conclusion, while generative AI has undoubtedly made life easier and tasks more efficient â€“ we must remember that they are tools designed to help us perform better not substitute for personal accountability or responsibility for output.</p>

<p>The former may dismiss the latter&rsquo;s knowledge due to their lack of hands-on experience, while theorists may look down upon practitioners for their perceived resistance to new ideas or methods and narrow field of focus.</p>
<p>This article aims to delve into this issue, explaining its dynamics, potential reasons behind it, strategies to overcome it, as well as the biases and logical fallacies that both parties might exhibit.</p>

  The theory-experience dichotomy

</h2>
<p>The theory-experience dichotomy is rooted in two distinct paths to expertise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Practical experience</li>
<li>Theoretical knowledge</li>
</ul>
<p>On one hand, individuals with years of experience in a field have honed their skills through practice. They&rsquo;ve been on the frontline dealing with real-world problems and situations which has allowed them to develop an instinctual understanding of their work.</p>
<p>As an industry expert you have to deliver results. And relying on tried and true methods from your arsenal of experience can seem the most reliable way to do so. However, it&rsquo;s important not to fall into complacency and remain open-minded towards competing or new theories and techniques.</p>
<p>On the other hand, individuals who lean heavily towards theory are often armed with the latest research findings and insights from a wider field of knowledge. They&rsquo;re well-versed in recent developments and new techniques that might not yet be applied widely in practice as well as competing ideas within the same field.</p>
<p>The lack of deep experience in one field can however lead to the <strong>Dunning-Kruger Effect</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> which refers to the cognitive bias where people with low knowledge or competence in a subject overestimate their abilities.</p>
<p>The belief that one knows more than they actually do can lead to oversimplified models or theories that do not take into account the many variables involved in real-world scenarios. This is a common pitfall for theoreticians who are not well-versed in the practical application of their theories.</p>
<p>Practitioners and theorists both have valuable contributions to make, and when they work together, they can help to challenge each other&rsquo;s assumptions, refine theories and practices, and push the boundaries of their field.</p>

  Overcoming the divide

</h2>
<p>Here are some strategies for overcoming this divide:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mutual Respect</strong>: Both parties should acknowledge the value each brings and appreciate that both theory and practice are important for comprehensive understanding.</li>
<li><strong>Effective Communication</strong>: Clear communication can help overcome misunderstandings between theorists and practitioners.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborate</strong>: Working together on projects or problems can help bridge the gap by showing firsthand how both types of expertise can complement each other.</li>
</ol>

  Logical fallacies

    <i class="fa-solid fa-link" aria-hidden="true" title="Link to heading"></i>
    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>Logical fallacies are errors in reasoning that undermine the logic of an argument.</p>
<p>Both practitioners and theorists may fall victim to these fallacies due to their inherent biases and perspectives.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at some logical fallacies and how both parties might fall into them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Appeal To Authority Fallacy</strong>: Practitioners, with years of hands-on experience, may consider themselves as authorities in their field and believe that their way of doing things is the right way, simply because they have been doing it for a long time. On the other hand, theorists may consider academic or research-based authorities as the only valid sources of true knowledge, dismissing the practical wisdom of practitioners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anecdotal Fallacy</strong>: Practitioners often base their knowledge on personal experiences and might use these experiences as evidence to support their claims or dismiss new theories. On the contrary, theorists might use anecdotal evidence from their research or readings to support their theories, ignoring the complexities and variables of real-world scenarios.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Red Herring Fallacy</strong>: Practitioners might introduce irrelevant information to distract from criticisms about their outdated methods or lack of theoretical knowledge. Similarly, theorists could use complex jargon or unrelated facts to steer the conversation away from practical implications or challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hasty Generalization Fallacy</strong>: This occurs when one makes a broad generalization based on a small or limited amount of examples. Practitioners, whose expertise is often based on personal experiences, might generalize those experiences to the whole field. Theorists, on the other hand, might generalize results from a single study or a limited set of data to larger contexts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Post Hoc Fallacy</strong>: Practitioners might attribute their success or failure in certain situations to specific actions they took, without considering other influencing factors. Theorists might mistakenly attribute cause-effect relationships between events just because they are sequentially aligned in their research data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Appeal To Tradition Fallacy</strong>: Practitioners may fall into this fallacy by assuming that something is better or correct simply because it&rsquo;s traditional, or &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the way it&rsquo;s always been.&rdquo; This fallacy rejects novelty and change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Appeal To Novelty Fallacy</strong>: Theorists, on the other hand, are always on the lookout for the latest research findings and techniques in their field. They might assume that just because an idea or method is new, it must be superior to traditional methods practiced by experienced professionals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cherry Picking Fallacy</strong>: Theorists might be tempted to pick out individual studies from their vast library of knowledge or data that support their views while ignoring those that contradict them. Practitioners might selectively use experiences or cases that support their methods and dismiss those that challenge them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Appeal to Ignorance Fallacy</strong>: Theorists may argue that their perspectives are correct because they can&rsquo;t be proven wrong, rather than providing evidence to prove them right. Practitioners may also fall into this fallacy by arguing that their methods work because there&rsquo;s no concrete evidence showing they don&rsquo;t.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By recognizing these logical fallacies, practitioners and theorists can strive to avoid them and engage in more productive and rational discussions.</p>
