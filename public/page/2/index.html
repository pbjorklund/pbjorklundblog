                        <p>Recency bias in language models like ChatGPT refers to the model&rsquo;s tendency to prioritize more recent inputs in the conversation when generating responses. This means that if you provide a long conversation history, while the model technically considers the entire input, it might weigh recent messages more heavily than earlier ones when generating a response. This can lead to situations where the model might not remember or refer back to earlier parts of the conversation correctly.</p>
<p>Related concepts are &ldquo;needle in haystack&rdquo; and that models tend to prioritize the beginning and end of inputs, &ldquo;ignoring&rdquo; the middle. This was a huge thing for Googles most recent Gemini models, being able to overcome this in hundred of thousand lines long contexts.</p>

                        <p>I was thinking: how do we separate established knowledge from emerging insights, especially when both are valuable? The introduction of generative AI and Language Models (LLM) adds another layer of complexity to this challenge.</p>
<p>Established knowledge, derived from reputable sources and expert opinions, acts as our anchor. It&rsquo;s been thoroughly vetted and is generally accepted as accurate. Yet, in a fast-evolving world, can we afford to rely solely on this?</p>
<p>New knowledge, on the other hand, is like the uncharted waters of innovation and discovery. It&rsquo;s exciting but comes with its own risks, primarily the uncertainty of its accuracy.</p>
<p>Generative AI and LLMs have emerged as tools that act as if they are guiding us through this area. They can provide direct answers and direct perspectives, bypassing traditional information gatekeepers. But there&rsquo;s a hitch: their training data includes both reliable and unreliable information. How then can we trust the guidance they offer?</p>
<p>To ensure that AI enabled tools that we build we could incorporate source credibility indicators and peer-review mechanisms into their design. This would help them differentiate between reliable and questionable information. Furthermore, recognizing knowledge as a continuum rather than a binary classification can refine their navigational capabilities.</p>
<p>Valuing the stability of established knowledge while being open to new insights is a tough balancing act as we further develop and refine our usage of AI technologies. Our focus should remain on enhancing their ability to discern the quality of information. This balance isn&rsquo;t just about leveraging technology; it&rsquo;s about fostering a culture of critical thinking and continuous exploration</p>

                        <p>There&rsquo;s this expectation for politicians and any person in a position of authority (or dare we say “influence”) to guide the general public through complex issues.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the thing - most of us don&rsquo;t have the bandwidth to really get into the nitty-gritty of every topic. So, we lean on these conduits for clarity. However, this reliance has a downside: it&rsquo;s a small step from being guided to being manipulated.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like, at what point do we stop making our own choices and start following a script laid out for us?</p>
<p>So, how should I navigate this maze without losing my agency? It&rsquo;s not about doubting everything but rather about engaging with information in a more thoughtful way.</p>
<p>Perhaps this checklist would help.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Accept that simple answers might not always cut it. It&rsquo;s about embracing the complexity rather than shying away from it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dig a bit deeper into issues. It&rsquo;s not about becoming an expert overnight but about trying to see beyond the surface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider who&rsquo;s talking and their possible motivations. This context can help differentiate genuine guidance from hidden manipulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Looking at different sources can help paint a fuller picture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about the intended effect of the statements on public opinion or policy. Who stands to gain, and what&rsquo;s their endgame?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think again and accept that truly thinking takes time and effort.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is really about taking charge of how to engage with information in general. It&rsquo;s about not being just a passive receiver but an active, informed member of the conversation.</p>
<p>So, the takeaway from today&rsquo;s reflection: stay informed, stay critical, and always keep questioning. And since it takes effort - be selective on what deserves attention.</p>

                        <p>Picture this: You have a 5-year-old and a 3-year-old that you need to get ready for school every morning. Your goal is to leave the house by 8:00 am.</p>
<p>Sounds simple, right? You might think, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wake up at 7:00 am, that should give me a whole hour to get ready - plenty of time&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Usually doesn&rsquo;t end well. Let&rsquo;s try employing the simple methodology of &ldquo;forwards thinking - backwards planning&rdquo;.</p>
<h2 id="forwards-thinking---backwards-planning">
  Forwards Thinking - Backwards Planning

    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>The &ldquo;forwards thinking - backwards planning&rdquo; strategy is a way to plan your time more effectively by starting at your end goal and working backwards, accounting for potential obstacles. Here&rsquo;s a simplified version of how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Identify your ultimate goal:</strong> In this case, it is to leave the house by 8:00 am. This is your endpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Estimate time for each task:</strong> Think about each task that needs to be done before you leave - waking up the kids, getting dressed, breakfast etc. and estimate how long each will take. Don&rsquo;t forget to consider potential hiccups that could delay you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Work backwards from your endpoint:</strong> Start from 8:00 am (your goal) and subtract the time each task will take from it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adjust as necessary:</strong> If you find that you&rsquo;ve run out of time before you&rsquo;ve accounted for all tasks, adjust your wake-up time or expected time to leave accordingly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The idea here is not to create a minute-by-minute schedule, but rather to give yourself a rough estimate of when certain milestones should be hit in order to reach your ultimate goal on time. It’s about understanding the order of operations and giving yourself enough buffer for unexpected delays or interruptions.</p>

    <span class="sr-only">Link to heading</span>
  </a>
</h2>
<p>Here is how an example plan would look in my mind. Broken down in 10 minute intervals for easy mental math:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>8:00 am:</strong> Leave the house (ultimate goal)</li>
<li><strong>7:50 am:</strong> Getting everyone out of the house and strapped into the car should take 5 minutes, 10 if they resist</li>
<li><strong>7:40 am:</strong> Everyone should be fully dressed, with bags packed. This might take 10 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>7:30 am:</strong> Teeth brushing is done by now, which on a good day takes 5 minutes, but let&rsquo;s add another 5 for unexpected tantrums.</li>
<li><strong>7:20 am:</strong> Breakfast should be finished. Eating can take around 10 minutes, but let&rsquo;s add another 10 for potential food-related issues.</li>
<li><strong>7:00 am:</strong> Breakfast is served. Preparing it might take around 10 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>6:50 am:</strong> Kids should be out of bed by this time. Waking them up and getting them out of bed can take around 10 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>6:40 am:</strong> Wake up. You need about 10 minutes to get ready before waking the kids.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, I should set my alarm to 6:40 instead of 7:00. 20 minutes less sleep for a more enjoyable morning.</p>

</h2>
<p>Forwards thinking - backwards planning is a simple yet effective strategy to manage your time better. It not only helps you plan your morning routine but also can be applied in numerous other situations like project management, event planning, or even in setting long-term personal goals.</p>
<p>In the context of project management, for example, let&rsquo;s say you have a project due in 6 months. If you start planning from today and move forward, you may underestimate the time it takes to complete certain tasks and overestimate your ability to get them done promptly. But if you start with the due date and work backwards, factoring in all tasks and potential obstacles, you will have a more realistic schedule that leaves room for unforeseen delays.</p>
<p>The beauty of this strategy is that it forces you to take into consideration every task involved in reaching your goal. It prompts you to think about what could possibly go wrong and plan for it accordingly.</p>

<p>An important thing to note is that the longer the period of time you&rsquo;re planning for, the more risk and uncertainty will be involved. Let&rsquo;s take the example of a long-term personal goal like starting a business. There are so many factors that could potentially derail your plans - market changes, personal circumstances, financial issues etc. Therefore, it is crucial to continuously revise and adjust your plan as you move forward.</p>
<p>This brings us to an insightful quote by Dwight D. Eisenhower: &ldquo;In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable&rdquo;. The core idea here is that while our initial plans may not always work out exactly as we envision, the process of planning is invaluable as it prepares us for potential roadblocks and gives us a sense of direction.</p>

<p>In conclusion, &ldquo;forwards thinking - backwards planning&rdquo; can be a game-changer in how you manage your time and tasks. It encourages proactivity rather than reactivity and allows you to better anticipate challenges before they arise.</p>
<p>Whether you&rsquo;re a busy parent trying to juggle morning routines or a project manager with deadlines looming, give this strategy a try and see how it can streamline your daily life and help you reach your goals more effectively.</p>
<p>Remember, success lies in your ability to foresee potential obstacles and being prepared to overcome them - plan backwards from your goal but think forwards towards its attainment!</p>
