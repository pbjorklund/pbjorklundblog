        <time>September 25, 2022</time>
        <div>Certain types of consulting is built on delivering multiple projects at the same time. This means a that the expectation of a high count of work in process is built into the company.
WIP has costs though. Quality goes down. Task switching goes up.
Can it only be done efficiently when little to no new knowledge needs to be built in the delivery process? Does the process needs to be so streamlined that all activities requires little to no change and just delivery?</div>

Fundamental to consulting is that you buy previous experience. Appeal to authority institutionalised. One might have done the wrong thing a 100 times, that does not make it right.</div>

Fresh start can help but won&rsquo;t bring you to the finish line. Rather run 1 marathon than 26 small training sessions.</div>
