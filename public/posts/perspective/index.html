“From a management perspective, having everything reduced to a process and method is the ideal world, as no true knowledge about the actual work is needed.

<p>This comment has haunted me for years.</p>
<p>I think it boils down to dissatisfaction with a purely mechanical approach to management, where processes and methods are prioritized over understanding the nuanced intricacies of the actual work being done.</p>
<p>This perspective might stem from a situation where managers are not deeply involved in the work their teams do or do not fully understand it.</p>
<p>In such cases, an over-reliance on processes could lead to inefficiencies, lack of innovation, and even resentment among team members who feel their expertise is undervalued.</p>
<p>As managers, we can learn several things from this viewpoint:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Deep Understanding: It&rsquo;s crucial to have a good grasp of what your team does and how they do it. Understanding the work allows you to make informed decisions that enhance productivity and efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Balance: While processes and methods are vital for consistency and order, they should not be rigid or stifle creativity. Striking a balance between structure and flexibility can foster innovation while maintaining organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Value Expertise: Acknowledge and respect your team&rsquo;s expertise. Their on-the-ground experience provides insights that can enhance workflow, solve problems faster, or create new opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communication: Regularly engage with your team members about their tasks rather than just focusing on outcomes. This shows your interest in their work and gives them a space to voice concerns or suggestions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adaptability: Be open to change when necessary. If a process isn&rsquo;t working as well as it could be, don&rsquo;t be afraid to adjust it based on input from those who use it most frequently.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, we should remember that management isn&rsquo;t just about control but also about facilitation – enabling our teams to perform at their best by providing them with the right mix of structure and freedom.</p>
