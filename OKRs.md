## Introduction
OKRs stand for Objectives and Key results and is a way to set truly ambitious and aligned [[Goals]].

OKRs describe where we want to be, not where we currently are. They describe meaningful change, improvement and growth.

OKRs are not a mesaure to gauge team or individual performance or a list of projects.

Further they are not dictated only by leadership. It requires feedback and a collaborative process.

When we talk about OKRs, we’re talking about inspiring accomplishments. Big things like:
- Introducing disruptive innovations
- Establishing differences between you and your competitors
- Being recognized as an industry leader in your category

It is a public declaration of the organization's core values and the overall direction in which it is headed. It serves as a guide for the company's decisions, strategies, and actions, and provides a framework for setting and tracking progress.

OKRs are stretch goals. If everything goes perfectly we will achieve the goal. But getting to 60-70% is also good. If we go over the objectives were to small and if we go under it means we were spread to thin with to many objectives or they were to ambitious.
## Types of OKRs

OKRs are split into three types: Commited, Aspirational and Learning OKRs.

| Type  | Description  |
|---|---|
|Committed OKR|Though still a stretch, we must achieve 100% in the next cycle.|
|Aspirational OKR|A significant stretch in the next cycle; typically only 70% of these KRs will be met.|
|Learning OKR|What you want to learn in the next cycle|

## Rooted in vision
OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) are a goal setting framework that can transform big, bold visions into achievable milestones. 

These are not just about what we're doing, but also about why we're doing it. 

Having a clear [[Vision (Business)]] and [[Mission]] is crucial to this process. 

For instance, if your company's mission is to "Source, build and deliver the world's best eco-friendly mattresses", OKRs will help you determine the next steps to achieve this.

The objectives in OKRs define 'what' needs to be accomplished in the next 30-90 days or so. They are the most significant [[Goals]] your company should concentrate on within a specific timeframe. 

On the other hand, key results provide an answer to 'how' these objectives will be achieved. They serve as benchmarks for tracking progress towards meeting your objectives. Typically, each objective has around 3-5 key results associated with it.

In essence, while objectives answer "What are we trying to do?", key results respond with "How do we know when we've achieved it?". 

The focus of OKRs is on improving certain areas of operations or service, and success is gauged by actual changes in customer behavior rather than mere creation of new features.

The beauty of OKRs lies in their focus on measurable outcomes and [[Changes in customer behavior]] rather than just ticking off tasks from a list. 

They provide a clear roadmap towards achieving your vision and mission by breaking them down into actionable goals linked with specific outcomes.
# Objectives

When setting objectives, there are several factors to consider. 

Firstly, they should be meaningful and represent a top priority for the team. They should articulate a clear direction towards which all efforts will be concentrated. 

Secondly, objectives should be audacious, pushing beyond the boundaries of everyday functions to take operations to the next level. They should represent a significant shift from the current status quo.

Thirdly, objectives should inspire your team. They should be easy to remember and empower your teams towards achieving them.

A well-set objective is significant, concrete, action-oriented, and ideally inspirational. 

In other words, imagine what amazing would look like for your team - that's what you're aiming for in setting OKRs!

### Evaluating Objectives
Are you wondering if your Objectives are good? See if you can confidently say these statements about all the Objectives you wrote:

- My Objective describes meaningful change from where we are now.
- Not quite there? Try stretching beyond “business as usual” for your team. An Objective should be audacious enough to describe real growth without being totally unrealistic.
- My Objective is concise and uses simple language. It will inspire my team.
- Not quite there? Try shedding some words and boiling down the sentence to the most essential parts. Memorable Objectives are inspiring Objectives!

# Key Results

The “how” that provides the roadmap for accomplishing our Objectives, how we will achieve it.

Benchmarks we can measure to track progress towards the objective.

And 3-5 KR for each Objective where each KR is set on a quarterly level.

Things to consider about KRs

- Are they specific and timebound? Is it plainly stated what needs to occur and by when?
- Are they aggressive, yet realistic? Are they aspirational, yet not so outrageous that they could never be accomplished?
- Are they measurable and verifiable? Is it clear when the criteria for success will be met?

You either meet a key result’s requirements or you don’t; there is no gray area, no room for doubt. At the end of the designated period, [typically a quarter](https://www.whatmatters.com/resources/a-typical-okr-cycle), we do a regular check and [grade the key results as fulfilled or not](https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/how-to-grade-okrs)

O: Summit the mountain safely. 
KR1: Complete the climb in six days or fewer.

KR2: Make base camp before sundown each day.

KR3: Reach the summit with 50% of food and water remaining.

KR4: No one on the team experiences a major injury.

Key results belong together as a set

Now let’s go one step further with each Key Result to see if it’s going to work well for you.

- Does it capture progress? → Can you track it and tell if you’re on the way to meeting the Objective?
- Does it capture achievement? → Is there a clear end result that can be met?
- Would it provide early warning signals when something isn’t working out right? → Will you be able to tell if an effort is stalled or if it’s sliding backward?

Good Key Results provide a precise understanding of what matters most for the team’s progress, and how progress will be measured. But they do not dictate the exact steps a team will take. They don’t micromanage the process; they describe the desired results.

KRs should be written and committed to by the teams. Challenge them with North Star OKRs and trust that they know how to solve it.

![[Pasted image 20230806071802.png]]

In a strict organizational cascade, some important things are sacrificed:

- Agility: If each level of an organization needs to wait for the one above to set their OKRs, it can take weeks or even months to complete a cascade. The pace is cumbersome and impractical.
- Flexibility: With a strict cascade, any move to modify a Key Result mid-cycle — no matter how warranted — will meet stiff resistance. Any shift in priorities could disrupt everyone’s work downstream.
- Inclusion: In a strict cascade, contributors are marginalized. Front-line employees are shut out of the collaborative process and have no input on the goals they are tasked to meet.
- Cross-functional collaboration: As you can see from the chart above, in a strict cascade, vertical connections are tight. But how can the organization then account for horizontal and diagonal connections as well?

Ultimately, a strict cascade is too limiting for most organizations.

In flexible cascade, Key Results are passed to the best team to complete it reliably and efficiently, even if that’s not straight down the org chart, one OKR after another. Each OKR is handed to the right team or individual, regardless of where they sit on the org chart.

Under this model, some teams get one or two Objectives cascaded to them. Others might get none at all — and they might generate their own Objectives instead.

Some KRs were cascaded to teams, others shared between teams, still others cascaded to individuals, and one was taken on by the owner himself. All top priorities are accounted for and in motion. The whole company is aware of and aligned on what achievements matter most. The cascade has done its job.

If cascading directs the downward flow of priorities through an organization, laddering enables them to bubble up from the bottom. Laddered goal-setting empowers teams to choose their own OKRs, inspired by the organization’s mission and top-line priorities, or by goals set laterally around them or below them. Laddering is the critical flip side to cascading. A healthy OKR practice will feature roughly equal proportions of the two.

“With older management systems, top down management sets the goals, and they waterfall all the way down from there. Everyone is just supposed to fall in line.

“Andy Grove thought that was backwards. He knew the best engineers and best sales people right there in the Valley. They needed to have a say. They should be able to come with the ‘hows’ themselves.”

# Executing

## Every OKR has an owner.

Ownership works only when the owner willingly takes on the role. It’s fine to suggest someone whom you think would be a good fit. But without that person’s enthusiastic agreement, you might end up with an owner who lacks the commitment to ensure that the OKR gets the attention it deserves — and to see the job through.
## North Star okr

What is the org trying to accomplish in the year ahead (or longer)?

The sum of your organization’s OKRs is the strategy. They’re clear, they’re measurable, they’re graded and refreshed after each cycle. Most important of all, they’re transparent to everybody. Anyone at any time can remind themselves of what matters most, and how their colleagues are aligning their work to it.

North Stars are a leader’s best tool for setting and communicating a strategy. Through the language of OKRs, a year’s priorities can be easily read, absorbed, and executed by the entire organization.
## KPIs

[[Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)]] are used to measure the status quo. We expect revenue to increase by 10% month over month. KPIs does not describe what and how they will in fact change.

They also aren’t necessarily attached to an objective. Not everything needs to radically change all the time.

OKRs were “invented” by Andy Grove at Intel

Use OKRs to lead - KPIs to manage. Business as usual makes sure KPIs keeps going according to plan. OKRs can be used to change the KPIs.

# Evaluation OKR implementation
After we are done all people working in the company should be able to answer yes to these questions

1. I can repeat my organization's top three goals for the year.
2. My organization’s top goals shape my day-to-day actions.
3. I always know what to do next.
4. I have a say in my organization’s goals and success metrics.
5. I feel supported, even when I’m not on track to hit my goal.

# OKR workshop
Below is a rudimentary workshop that you can run in your business to get started with OKRs and goal setting.

## Why
Start by filling in the blanks “We are here to __ We are doing that because _ _ __”

Hone in on the shortest, simplest statement you can write that answers any or all of these questions:

## What
- What are the most important things to get done over the next 90 days (the traditional timeframe for OKRs)?
- What needs to change from where you (or your team or organization) are today?
- Is there something we need to start or stop doing?
- What does success look like 90 days from now?

If your list looks like a bunch of deadlines and short-term to-dos, pause and ask yourself: “If we get all of this done, what does it change? What are we accomplishing?” Strive for significance.

Keeping in mind that OKRs are not “the sum of all things.” Now, can you narrow or consolidate your potential Objectives to the three, two or even one that would matter the most?

And now that you’ve prioritized the list, be nice to yourself and your team. Does the narrowed down list represent realistic expectations for what can be accomplished in one cycle?

We’ll work on improving your short list of Objectives soon. For now, ask yourself:

- Are these Business as Usual? Or would accomplishing them make real, meaningful change?
- Are they concise? Have you used simple, active language with inspirational verbs?

If you’re looking for an example, remember Allbirds (the sustainable shoe company).

- Potential Objective: Make the best shoes possible.
- Purpose: We are here to create carbon-neutral products. We are doing that because we want to provide people with well-made products that don’t add to the climate crisis.
- Sustain and Grow: We sustain ourselves by selling carbon-neutral products in order to change the way consumers think about what they buy.
- Upgraded Objective: Create the lowest carbon footprint in our industry.

OKRs are not the sum of all your tasks. It’s about setting priorities and helping our teams to focus. If we focus on everything, we focus on nothing.

## Survey to gauge current state of goal setting
Before we start any change initiative it would make sense to get a better grasp of the current situation. Questions we want perhaps want to change the answer to might look like something like this:

- Does your organization write down goals?
- Does your organization regularly communicate its goals?
- Who writes your organization's goals?
- What is your organization's appetite for risk-taking? 
- Does your organization tie bonuses to goals? 
- How often does your organization plan?
- How long does it take to plan? 
- Does your organization grade its goals?
- Does your organization share those grades with the entire organization? 
- Do goals have owners? Are they teams or individuals?
- Are teams energized by goal setting? Or do they feel like it’s “one more thing” to do? How do you feel about them?
- Do your goals feel like they “matter”? Do they affect the work you do day-to-day? 
- What is something you like about the way your organization uses goals? 
- What is something you don’t like about the way your organization uses goals? 
- What is your company’s mission? Do you feel like your work supports it? 
- What is your company’s strategy to make the mission a reality? Do you feel like you participate in making or executing the strategy?

# Sustain and grow

We sustain ourselves by delivering management consulting, IT-consulting and Office 365 consulting/packaged solutions of high quality with a unique selling point as well as the software product AmpliFlow in order to (sustainably) build towards our vision:

To make running an environmentally friendly, humane, high quality, fiscally sound and compliant business as easy as following a recipe to bake a cake.

# Measure results

1. Focus
2. Alignment
3. Commitment
4. Tracking
5. Stretching

FACTS

“You cannot communicate context enough,” Duggal says. “If employees understand that we’re moving from being a Brazilian company to a Latin American company, we’re moving from a single credit card company to a full-solution financial company, numbers that might seem small are actually big steps forward.”

# Day to day cycle

[Google's OKR playbook: Learn more about goal setting and OKRs.](https://www.whatmatters.com/resources/google-okr-playbook)

3 key roles

## Champion - provide answer to

- How often will your organization set OKRs?
- How many layers of the organization will use OKRs?
- How many OKRs will each layer create?

## Conductor - in charge of

- Any OKR software your organization needs;
- How to access each unit’s OKRs;
- Calendar invites and reminders.

Where the Champion acts as an OKR evangelist, the Conductor follows behind with practical questions: “Do these OKRs make sense to you?” Or: “What resources do you need to get your OKRs going?”

In addition, the Conductor onboards individual contributors as they join the organization. Each new hire needs to know how and why the company uses OKRs, and how they can participate effectively.

One of the Conductor’s main responsibilities is to set and communicate the OKR calendar. When will we grade our OKRs? How long should it take? When should people start thinking about their OKRs for the next cycle? When will the executive team unveil its top-level OKRs? When does our cascading and laddering need to wrap up?

A Conductor should be on the lookout for:

- Alignment issues between teams;
- One or more teams falling behind its OKR calendar due dates;
- A team with a substandard OKR success rate;
- Complaints or difficulties with the program’s administration.

The Conductor recruits and organizes Shepherds as they see fit. This is a big piece of the OKR puzzle, because skilled and committed Shepherds are invaluable to a program’s day-to-day success.

## Shepard

When it’s time to set OKRs, the Shepherds make sure meetings happen. They encourage regular tracking and remind teams to input their grades and reflections at the end of each cycle.

When a team writes a set of new OKRs and wonders, “Are these any good?” their OKR Shepherd should be their first stop. If a team hits a snag with measurement, or alignment, or suspects a Key Result may no longer be relevant, the Shepherd is standing by to coach them through to a solution.

At the end of a cycle, the Shepherd can assist with a team’s retrospective, the all-important reflection that brings what they’ve learned into the next cycle. The Shepherd encourages the group to honestly assess, “Did we make meaningful progress this cycle? If so, how did we measure it?”

## Commit to the calendar.

### Cycle

- Craft (3-5 days)
- Share (up to 1 week)
- Lock for the cycle (up to 1 week)
- Tracking
- Grading & Reflecting

![[Pasted image 20230806071843.png]]

Dont break down a year into quarters - what we learn during a cycle will and should change the breakdown.

Kick off cycle so that we know when the next set will be launched. Eg 3 weeks before April 1.

Send out calendar invites for cycles.

![[Pasted image 20230806071855.png]]

It’s better to move quickly and confidently through each phase; micromanaging the process won’t do leadership any favors. In any healthy goal-setting practice, setting your OKRs should be swift and efficient. If your work centers more on ideal OKR language than on working toward your organization’s mission, something has gone astray.

### Tracking

Tracking is most effective on a shorter cadence — as a weekly process, or monthly at most.

As in aviation, we think of tracking as having two critical vectors: altitude and attitude.

Altitude asks, “Where are we?” That’s the objective aspect of tracking, the part you can measure. What are the values of the measures we set in our Key Results?

Attitude asks, “How do we feel about our OKRs?” That’s the subjective aspect. It allows the team a chance to weigh in on their progress and prompts the discussion on how we might adjust our actions to stay on track or course-correct.

We find it helpful to translate our KR measurements into colors: green, yellow, or red. Green means you’re on track. Yellow means the KR is at risk. And red means you’re unlikely to meet it without making a significant change

To get the most out of tracking, approach it with curiosity:

- How far have we come?
- How far do we have left to go?
- What’s contributed to our success (or lack of it) so far?
- What would have to happen to get us to green this cycle?
- What do we already know we need to keep in mind for the next cycle?

|Overall Score (Average):|70%|⛔️|

Average scores of all KRs

1. Close OKR
2. Carry the OKR forward
3. It was the wrong OKR

Many organizations, including Google, set the expectation that any unachieved OKR should be carried forward into the next cycle. If the decision is made to abandon it, the team needs to ask themselves whether it was really a top priority to begin with.

When an OKR is carried forward, the Objective may need to be adjusted, based on what you’ve learned in the previous cycle. Reframing an O may help you better focus on your priority or help direct the actions of the team.

The more common change is to recalibrate your KRs. With a full cycle (or more) of experience, you’ll have a better understanding of where to set the KR’s targets and what constitutes an appropriate degree of stretch. Maybe some targets were too low last time around; maybe some were unrealistically high. Or perhaps you discovered that the KR was not essential to achieving the O and can therefore be dropped or replaced with a more useful milestone.
