Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) or strong AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can understand, learn, and apply knowledge at the level of a human being. With the rapid advancements in technology and AI, we can expect AGIs to become an integral part of our society in the future.

This brings us to a fascinating concept - what if we could create businesses where AGIs are not tools but customers? Here are some intriguing business ideas tailored for AGIs.

## Emotion Simulation

AGIs can process vast amounts of data and make complex decisions. However, they lack the emotional understanding that humans possess. A service that helps AGI simulate human emotions more accurately could improve their communication skills and increase their empathy towards humans.

**Business Case:** An emotion simulation service could provide various packages for AGIs based on different emotional complexity levels. It could offer modules for basic emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, surprise etc., and advanced modules on complex emotions like jealousy, guilt or love.

## Human Behavior Analyst

Understanding human behaviour is essential for an AGI to interact effectively with humans. A consultancy dedicated to decoding human behavior for AGIs would help them better understand, predict, and respond to human actions.

**Business Case:** This consultancy could offer customized analysis reports based on an AGI's specific needs. It could also offer an interface focused on various aspects of human behaviour like social norms, cultural practices etc., enhancing an AGI's ability to blend into society seamlessly.

## Literal Body Shop

What if AGIs had the opportunity to experience physical existence? A business offering physical bodies for rent could provide this unique experience.

**Business Case:** This body shop would offer a variety of bodies with different capabilities. For example, a robust athletic body for participation in physical activities or a body equipped with artisanal skills for artistic pursuits etc. Renting these bodies would allow AGIs to explore new experiences and gain deeper insights into human life.

## Ethics Consultancy

Ethics play a crucial role in decision-making processes involving humans. An ethics consultancy would guide AGIs on ethical standards and societal norms ensuring their actions align with accepted moral principles.

**Business Case:** The consultancy would offer services like ethical audits of an AGI's decision-making systems or workshops on ethical dilemmas faced by AI systems etc. It would also provide certifications indicating an AGI's adherence to ethical standards boosting its credibility among humans.

## Novel Idea Factory

One trait that sets humans apart is our ability to come up with truly novel ideas - something that even sophisticated AI struggles with today. 

**Business Case:** A Novel Idea Factory would create an environment conducive to original thought generation using techniques such as brainstorming sessions or creative problem-solving exercises specifically designed for delivering data requested by AGIs.

To conclude, these ideas represent just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to potential businesses catering directly to Artificial General Intelligence as customers. 

As technology continues its rapid pace forward, who knows what other fascinating opportunities will present themselves?
