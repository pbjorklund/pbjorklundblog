The societal pressure to be productive is at an all-time high. Hustle culture, "just get sh\*t done", "No-one succeeded by working 40 hour weeks" is a constant reminder in our social feeds. Self-help books, motivational speakers, and social media influencers who promote extreme productivity with posts like "How I study for 18 hours without getting tired" seems to be everywhere. And this is what is starting to be referred to more and more as "Toxic Productivity".

Toxic productivity is the state of pushing oneself to be productive at any cost, ignoring other facets of your life. It may seem beneficial in the short term as it often leads to increased performance due to that inital adrenaline rush or that feeling of truly being on the right path for once. However, this relentless pursuit of efficiency is not sustainable and often results in burnout, stress, mental health issues like anxiety or depression, and even physical ailments such as heart disease.

Ironically, toxic productivity often also leads to even more procrastination - we procrastinate by trying to figure out how to not procrastinate. 

Although these productivity gurus may seem appealing due to their success stories, these portrayals often gloss over the risk of burnout and mental health struggles associated with such behaviour. Also interesting to see how some of the more succesful influencers that started with the clickbait titles and built up a huge following now comes out with things like "Stress free productivity" or "I burnt out. Here is what I changed".

Instead of striving for non-stop productivity, it's healthier and more sustainable to set realistic goals that align with your personal capabilities and lifestyle. This can prevent feelings of failure when unrealistic expectations aren’t met – thereby counteracting toxic productivity.

Moreover, incorporating self-care activities into your routine is not a waste of time but a critical part of maintaining overall health and wellbeing – thereby enhancing true productivity in the long run.

Workplaces also play a crucial role in either promoting or counteracting toxic productivity. Organizations should strive for cultures that value balance and wellbeing alongside productivity. Implementing policies such as flexible working hours or providing mental health support can help prevent toxic work environments.

To combat toxic productivity, consider techniques such as _simple_ time management strategies instead of convoluted ones, mindfulness practices or simply turning off email and notifications for an hour per day. If feelings of burnout persist despite these measures, seeking professional help like therapy or coaching could be beneficial.

At its core, true productivity isn’t about working harder but about working _smarter_ and _sustainably_ – prioritizing tasks effectively is one thing, getting them done is another. But we should remember that taking breaks are not hindrances but fundamental components for producing quality work. Ever banged your head against the keyboard for hours without making progress on something truly difficulty and then going to the bathroom only to instantly come up with the solution? Yeah, breaks are the true productivity super power. 

Rest must not be seen as an adversary but an essential partner in our quest for genuine productivity. By maintaining a healthy balance between work and rest—and being mindful not to fall into the trap of toxic productivity—we can perform at our best while safeguarding our wellbeing.
